<h2>🧑‍💻 About me</h2>
<p>
I'm a first-year Computer Science student at NC State who enjoys building practical tools, learning how real systems work, and improving a little each day. I like taking ideas from a rough concept to something functional and reliable, and I'm constantly looking for ways to deepen my understanding of software engineering.
</p>
<p>
Outside of development, I compete in VR esports (Breachers), explore real-time systems and VR technologies, and stay focused on building a strong foundation for future work in immersive and full-stack software.
</p>

<h2>🚀 What I'm building</h2>

<h3>🔗 Inlync - Cross-platform chat unifier</h3>
<p>
Inlync started as a personal project to unify Twitch, YouTube, and Kick chats into one interface. It's grown into a real system featuring async event handling, OAuth integrations, and a clean, functional GUI.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently working on designing the full-stack version — accounts, subscriptions, a desktop client, and more scalable architecture. It's been one of the best projects for learning how to think like a software engineer.
</p>

<h3>🛠️ Mini Projects and Tests to Solidify Reading</h3>
<p>
Currently I have a few Python books that I am reading through, and most of my time currently is being spent reading those books and doing mini projects based on the chapters that I have read. The books I plan on reading or am currently reading are listed below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python Crash Course 2nd Edition</li>
  <li>Beyond The Basic Stuff With Python</li>
  <li>Robust Python</li>
  <li>Classic Computer Science Problems in Python/li>
  <li>Effective Python</li>
  <li>Flask Web Development</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎯 Where I'm heading</h2>
<p>
I'm working toward software engineering and immersive tech roles. My plan is to learn quickly, ship meaningful projects, build a strong portfolio, and prepare for <strong>SWE internships in Summer 2026</strong>.
</p>

<h2>📫 Let's connect</h2>
<p>
If you're building something interesting — a tool, an app, or anything in VR - I'm always open to talk or collaborate.
