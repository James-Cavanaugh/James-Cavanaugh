Software Developer • CS @ NC State • Builder of things that shouldn’t work but somehow do

<br>














</div>
<div align="center"> I’m a first-year CS student who likes building tools, messing with real-time systems, and stretching projects way past their “prototype” phase. If we were chatting over coffee, you’d probably hear me talk about the weird things I'm building and how they broke before they worked. </div>
<div align="center">🚀 What I’m Building</div>
<div align="center">🔗 Inlync — Cross-Platform Chat Unifier</div>
<div align="center">

Originally a Python project to combine Twitch, YouTube, and Kick chat.
Now it’s turning into something bigger: real-time message handling, OAuth integrations, a desktop client, and eventually a full-stack app with accounts and subscriptions.

Clean UI, reliable async systems, and an actually pleasant chat experience — that’s the goal.

<div align="center">🛠️ Tools, Experiments & Workflow Stuff</div>
<div align="center">

I write a lot of small tools that make my workflow better:

Data-processing scripts

GUI prototypes

Algorithm playgrounds

Automation tools

Anything that solves an annoyance

These projects teach me fundamentals while giving me instant quality-of-life improvements.

<div align="center">

I like stepping out of pure software and touching real hardware.
Working with microcontrollers forces me to think carefully about memory, timing, and communication — which makes me a stronger developer.

</div>
<div align="center">🧠 What I’m Into</div>
<div align="center">

Full-stack development • Real-time systems • VR/AR design • Systems programming •
Competitive VR gaming (Breachers) • Clean, meaningful UI/UX

</div>
<div align="center">🎯 Where I’m Heading</div>
<div align="center">

I’m building toward software engineering and immersive tech roles.
Right now I’m focused on learning quickly, building things that matter to me, and getting ready for SWE internships starting Summer 2026.

</div>
<div align="center">🔥 Current Focus</div>
<div align="center">

Finishing and polishing Inlync

Planning the full-stack version

Building out my GitHub portfolio

Strengthening DS&A and systems fundamentals

Exploring VR/AR interface patterns and real-time pipelines
