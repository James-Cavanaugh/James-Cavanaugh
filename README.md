<h2 align="left">🧑‍💻 About me</h2>
<p align="left">
I'm a first-year Computer Science student at NC State who enjoys building practical tools, learning how real systems work, and improving a little each day. I like taking ideas from a rough concept to something functional and reliable, and I'm constantly looking for ways to deepen my understanding of software engineering.
</p>
<p align="left">
Outside of development, I compete in VR esports (Breachers), explore real-time systems and VR technologies, and stay focused on building a strong foundation for future work in immersive and full-stack software.
</p>

<h2 align="left">🚀 What I'm building</h2>

<h3 align="left">🔗 Inlync - Cross-platform chat unifier</h3>
<p align="left">
Inlync started as a personal project to unify Twitch, YouTube, and Kick chats into one interface. It's grown into a real system featuring async event handling, OAuth integrations, and a clean, functional GUI.
</p>
<p align="left">
I'm currently working on designing the full-stack version — accounts, subscriptions, a desktop client, and more scalable architecture. It's been one of the best projects for learning how to think like a software engineer.
</p>

<h3 align="left">🛠️ Tools and workflow experiments</h3>
<p align="left">
I regularly build small utilities that solve problems I run into — automation scripts, quick GUIs, algorithm playgrounds, and data-processing tools. These help me sharpen fundamentals while improving my day-to-day workflow.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="left">🎯 Where I'm heading</h2>
<p align="left">
I'm working toward software engineering and immersive tech roles. My plan is to learn quickly, ship meaningful projects, build a strong portfolio, and prepare for <strong>SWE internships in Summer 2026</strong>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 align="left">🔥 Current focus</h2>

Polishing the Python version of <strong>Inlync</strong><br/>
Designing the full-stack architecture for its next stage<br/>
Strengthening DS&A and systems fundamentals<br/>
Building out a clean, representative GitHub portfolio<br/>
Studying real-time VR and interaction systems<br/>

<h2 align="left">📫 Let's connect</h2>
<p align="left">
If you're building something interesting — a tool, an app, or anything in VR — I'm always open to talk or collaborate.
