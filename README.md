<!-- Hello anyone reading this, I vibe coded this thing before I learned HTML. I learned HTML and now I'm just changing all of the content to be from me and adding/removing sections to reflect what I'm doing currently. I plan on coming back to revamp the structure when I have more time but I hope the ai structure doesn't dissuade you. -->

<h2>🧑‍💻 About me</h2>
<p>
I'm a first-year Computer Science student at NC State who enjoys programming, learning how real systems work, and improving a little each day. I like learning new languages, concepts, data structures, and programming patterns. I'm constantly looking for ways to deepen my understanding of software engineering each day.
</p>
<p>
Outside of development, I compete in VR esports (Breachers), explore open source projects and VR tech, and stay focused on building a strong foundation for future work in whatever programming field I choose to go into.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>I am currently searching for an internship in Software Engineering for summer 2026.</strong>
</p>

<h2>🚀 What I'm building</h2>

<h3>🔗 Inlync - Cross-Platform Chat Unifier</h3>
<p>
Inlync started as a personal project to unify Twitch, YouTube, Kick, and pretty much any other livestreaming chats into one interface. It's still a big work in progress that I've put to the side for the time being to focus on reading and other simpler projects.
</p>

<h3>🍔 Fastr - Mobile Fasting Timer</h3>
<p>
  Fastr is a personal project that I am working on in large part for my parents to be able to track their fasting time and give them statistics, graphs, and general insight all on their phones. I am making it using Kivy in Python, and right now the project is very bare bones but is functional (check out the repo if you are interested)
</p>

<h3>🛠️ Reading and Side-Projects</h3>
<p>
Currently I have a few Python books that I am reading through, and most of my time currently is being spent reading those books and doing projects based on the chapters that I have read. The books I plan on reading or am currently reading are listed below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python Crash Course 2nd Edition</li>
  <li>Beyond The Basic Stuff With Python</li>
  <li>Robust Python</li>
  <li>Classic Computer Science Problems in Python/li>
  <li>Effective Python</li>
  <li>Flask Web Development</li>
</ul>
<p>
